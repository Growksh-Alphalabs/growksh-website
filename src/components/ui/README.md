This folder contains shadcn-style UI components for the project.

Files added:
- `animated-hero.tsx` — animated hero component using framer-motion + lucide-react icons
- `demo.tsx` — simple demo wrapper
- `button.tsx` — shadcn-like Button component (depends on `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`)

Notes:
- The project currently doesn't have TypeScript, Tailwind or the shadcn CLI installed.
- The component files are TypeScript (`.tsx`). Install TypeScript and related types or convert to `.jsx/.js` if you prefer JavaScript.

Usage:
Import `Hero` from `src/components/ui/animated-hero` and place it on a page.

Installation instructions are provided in the project README and below.
